# StressomeExplorer

This app enables the inspection of raw data associated with the publication (REF) on a per gene basis.
The user can input the name of a gene of interest and data across datasets will be presented in a intuitive way.
There are three different types of datasets that can be inspected, transcriptomic, proteomic and phospho-proteomic.

To launch the app, use:
```{r}
shiny::runApp('/path/app')
```
